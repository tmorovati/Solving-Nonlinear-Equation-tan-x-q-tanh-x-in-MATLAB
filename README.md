# Solving-Nonlinear-Equation-tan-x-q-tanh-x-in-MATLAB

## Project Description
This MATLAB project aims to solve the nonlinear equation tan(x) = q tanh(x), where 'x' is the unknown variable, and 'q' is a positive real number. The program is designed to extract the first 'n' roots of this equation, where 'n' is a natural number provided by the user.

## System Requirements
1. MATLAB: Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you saved the project.

3. Open the `solve_nonlinear_equation.m` script in MATLAB.

4. Customize the following parameters:
   - `q`: Input the positive real number 'q' you want to use for the equation.
   - `n`: Input the number of roots 'n' you want to extract.
